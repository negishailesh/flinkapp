state is a snapshot of a application at any point of time which remembers information about past input/events.

state can be used in following ways:

> to search for certain event pattern happen so far.
> can be used in machine learning model.
> can be used when historic data needs to be managed.
> can be used to achieve fault-tolerance through check pointing.A state can help in restarting the job from failure point.
> can be used in rescaling of jobs.
> can be used to convert stateless transformation to stateful transformation.


statelessTransformation > in which current output is dependent on current output element and is independent of what
                            element came so far.
        ex: map,flatmap,filter

statefulTransformation > in which current output is dependent on current input as well as previous input element.
                            we need to accumulate the results.

        ex: reduce,sum,aggregate




TYPES OF STATE:
*keyed state
    state is bound to 1 operator instance ,1 state per operator instance( in cluster).

**operator state
    1 state per operator instance per key.
