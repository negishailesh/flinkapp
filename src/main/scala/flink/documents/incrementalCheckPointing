*in incremental checkpointing, we don't write the full state for evevry checkpoint for consecutive states
we will only save the Delta(change between 2 checkpoints).

** incremental checkpointing is not enabled by default, to enable it follow below:
    RocksDBStateBackend backed = new RocksDBStatebackend(filebackend , true);
