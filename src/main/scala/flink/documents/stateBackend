state backend determines how and where a checkpointed state is stored internally.

few available state backends are:
*memory statebackend : stores the state's data internally as onject on java heap.
**FS state backend : stores the state's data internally into specified filesystem ex: HDFS
***RocksDB statebackend : stores in-flight data(temp data) in RocksDB database, upon checkpointing the same is written to filesystem(HDFS)
